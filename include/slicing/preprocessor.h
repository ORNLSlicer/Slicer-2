    //! \class Preprocessor
    //! \brief An iterative system to cross-section and prepare parts/ meshes to have tool-paths generated. At a high
    //!        level, this class iterates through parts, then meshes and then cross-sections. You can supply custom processing in
    //!        the form of: \code std::functions<bool(SomeKindOfProcessing)> \endcode to various stages of the pipeline. See individual modes for
    //!        exactly what each one of these functions are called.
    //!   This class is separated into two major modes:
    //!         A. Whole-part approach:
    //!             This method replaces the old system used by PolymerSlicer. It assumes that all parts can be sliced from start
    //!             to end with all information. This mode can be triggered by using the processAll() call.
    //!
    //!             Preprocessing occurs in this order:
    //!                 1. Initial Processing: provides access to all parts/ global settings before any steps are created
    //!                 2. Part Processing: provides access to single part and its settings
    //!                 3. Mesh Processing: provides access to single mesh and its parent part's settings
    //!                 4. Step Builder: serves as instructions to build steps from a single cross-sectional slice
    //!                 5. Cross Section Processing: allows for access to all cross-sections in a mesh
    //!                 6. Status Update: provides access to a percentage of the total number of parts done
    //!                 7. Final Processing: provides access to all parts/ global settings after all steps are created
    //!
    //!         B. Single-step approach:
    //!             This method enables real time slicing. It differs from the whole-part approach in that it only computes a single layer/ step
    //!             per call. This method utilizes two calls: processInitial() runs code once before any steps are generated, and processNext()
    //!             which loads each part with up to one layer to process next.
    //!
    //!             Preprocessing occurs in this order:
    //!                 Before any layers can be processed:
    //!                     1. Initial Processing: provides access to all parts/ global settings before any steps are created
    //!                     2. Part Processing: provides access to single part and its settings
    //!                     3. Mesh Processing: provides access to single mesh and its parent part's settings
    //!                 On each call to processNext():
    //!                     1. Step Builder: serves as instructions to build a single step from a single cross-sectional slice for a part
    //!                     2. Cross Section Processing: allows for access to newly generated step on part
    //!                     3. Final Processing: provides access to all parts/ global settings after all steps are created for this layer
    //!                 \note processNext() will only slice parts who form the next global layer. It also returns a boolean to signal if a layer was
    //!                       created or when no more layers can be processed.
