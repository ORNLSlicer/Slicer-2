     * \class PointOrderOptimizer
     * \brief This class is used to select specific points on a polyline to link to
     *
     * \note These are how the optimizations are handled:
     * \note Non-implemented optimizations default to shortest distance
     * \list Next Closest – Pick the point on the polyline that is closest to the current location.
     * \list Next Farthest – Pick the point on the polyline that is farthest from the current location.
     * \list Random – Randomly select a point on each polyline.
     * \list Consecutive – Move the start point a minimum user defined distance from the previous layer’s start point.
     * \list Custom Point – User defines a custom point, and the optimizer picks the point on each polyline that is closest to the defined point.
