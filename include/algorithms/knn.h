 * \brief Provides access to both a CPU and GPU implementation of a K nearest neighbors algorithm. Takes in reference
 * points and and compares each supplied query point to find the K nearest neighbors. It is based off a CUDA kNN library
 * and includes support for using a GPU global memory, texture memory or the CUBLAS library. This class is built off the
 * Algorithm base class the handles GPU and CPU selection. An Algorithm constructor must be included when kNN is created
 * to specify the number of GPUs this algorithm uses.

    //!       - TEXTURE: Uses the GPU texture memory to store reference points and global memory for everything else.
    //!       Using a texture usually speeds-up computations
    //!                  compared to global but due to the size constraint of the texture structures in CUDA, this
    //!                  implementation might not an option for some high dimensional problems.
    //!       - CUBLAS: Uses the Cuda Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms library. Computation of the distances are split
    //!       into several sub-problems better suited to a GPU acceleration.
    //!                 As a consequence, on some specific problems, this implementation may lead to a much faster
    //!                 processing time but may not give an optimal solution.
