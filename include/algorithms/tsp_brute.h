 * \class TspBrute
 *
 * \brief Provides access to both CPU and GPU implementation of a brute-force traveling salesman problem solver. Takes
 * in islands and uses their center of mass as coordinates to find the shortest circuit. Since we pick our starting
 * island and do not have to return to it, this reduces to number of permutations form N! to (N-1)!. The CPU
 * implementation uses recursion to find the shortest path. The GPU implementation uses factoradics and parallel
 * reduction to compute the shortest path. When benchmarked the CPU implementation faster for N up to 5 before it starts
 * to become much slower. At 11 islands, the GPU implementation runs around 72 times faster than the CPU. This class is
 * built off the Algorithm base class the handles GPU and CPU selection. An Algorithm constructor must be included when
 * TspBrute is created to specify the number of GPUs this algorithm uses(currently 1).
